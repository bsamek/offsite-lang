As a user, I can
- Ingest a paragraph of text in a foreign language.
- Review all paragraphs of text I’ve ingested.
- Click on words I do not know, and type their definition.
- Toggle whether definitions for words I do not know are displayed.
- Later, when I ingest another paragraph of text, words I previously indicated I did not know will be highlighted.

As potentially later improvements, flashcards for words you don’t know, so that when you reread paragraphs you can tell you’ve learned things.

I want to try this with stitch, but I haven’t thought about the data model, and I don’t know how it’ll work. I plan to set up stitch first and see how far I can get.
